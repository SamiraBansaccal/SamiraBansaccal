# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @SamiraBansaccal, a noob and web-dev wannabe @BeCode

## üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in political sciences but i don't like to talk about it...

- BC it's what i studied @university for several years so it has shaped the way I see the world but I don't like to talk about politics because it's often an ego-debate between people more than actualy seeking for solutions/facts (in my humble opinion) but despite that, i often think about political views no matter what's the issues, even in web developpement field. That's why i'm really lookin forward to work on projects aiming to be useful to our society. Maybe to improve politcics-citizens relationship or just a useful tool to public administrations to avoid being dependant on foreign and *too big to trust* companies.

## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning web developpment @BeCode

### The Objectives I want to achieve as a developer during Becode

- being able to conceive a web solution to a real life issue
- have a better understanding of what is possible and what is not, what is ambitious and what is not,...in other words : to know my tools and what i can do with it :)
- link my previous learnings (so mostly political sciences) to the next (web developpement) so i can be hybride ü¶ñ to look for a job 

### My Fears

- I'm afraid to betrayed my political beliefs because i don't understand enough of the topic i'm workin on
- I'm afraid to not be able to communicate as well in english than i do in french, my mothertong
- I'm afraid to be deceived by the jobs in the field (get bored or something)
- I'm afraid to participate in anyway in some project that i might regret later. Like the guy who uload an open-source plan to print a fonctionnal 3D gun at home (well, he doesn't regret anything but i would), or those workin on tech to have as much of your watchtime on their plateform (netflix, insta and co...) My opinion is that those kind of jobs don't bring good stuff to our society but play on its bias to mess with it. So I really hope that 10years from now, i won't find myself in that kind of employement.

### The things I look forward to

- get a job in tech field
- learn soooo much new skill
- meet interresting and kind people
- competition (I must admit that I really like competition, but I'm a good player so I also like teamspirit, camaradery and kindness as I hate cheater and selfishness.

### The things I value the most to work as a team

- As I said, i like competition, put a prize on something, even as a joke, and it will speak directly to my competitive mind
- I like when my teamates aren't afraid to speak their mind (bc, if not, i try to be nice and helpful, but to be honnest, i'm not comfortable when i feel people don't really dare to say what they think about the groupe decision but i get that some are more shy or else than other)
- a bit like competition, i love to be impressed by my teamates, it force me to be and do better
- I love treating issues with jokes, so my fav teamate should be smart, not too shy or selfish, and funny

## ü¶ñ My most surprising skills

- I can crack wierd bones of mine **#Oupsi**
- I can go shopping for something and come back with everything exept the one i went for
- I can tell a short story long
